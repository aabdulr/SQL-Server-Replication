A script to initialize SQL Server Replication Using Backup

I wrote a blog post on how to set up SQL Server Replication using a backup. This option is essential for instances where
you do not wish to initialize replication via snapshot approach as it would take down production servers.

This is also very useful in instances where the database is just too big and a snapshot creation will take forever.

Hope this helps someone out there.
